  <li>Define a function, as a function declaration, `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If they are the same, return that number. Use the if-else construct or a ternary expression -  the Math.max method is not allowed</li><br>
  <li>Define a function as a function expression, `maxOfThree`, that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Again, the Math.max method is not allowed</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function declaration, `isCharAVowel` that takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function expression, `sumArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, `sumArray([2, 4, 5]);` would return `11`</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function declaration, `multiplyArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns the product of those numbers. For example, `multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]);` would return `40`.</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function expression, `numArgs` that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function declaration, `reverseString` that takes a string, reverses the characters, and returns it. For example, `reverseString('rockstar');` would return the string "ratskcor".</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function expression, `longestStringInArray` that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns the longest string's length.</li><br>
  <li>Define a function, as a function declaration, `stringsLongerThan` that takes an array of strings and a number as arguments; and returns an array of the strings that are longer than the number passed in. For example, `stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 3);` would return `["hello", "morning"]`.</li><br>
