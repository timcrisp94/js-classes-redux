  <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">CLASSES</a></h2>

  <p>instance: an object that is created by a js-classes-redux<br>
  instantiate: we instantiate a class to create an object<br>
  instantiation: the process of creating the object</p>

  <p>Encapsulation is a central principle of object-oriented programming.<br>
    Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (properties/attributes) and related behavior (methods) within an object.</p>

  <p>The concept of object-orient thinking is this:
    <ol>
      <li>create the blueprint</li>
      <li>build these methods to create behaviors and change properties and have the state change according to your needs</li>

    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>Some concluding thoughts on JavaScript on the occassion of Classes</h2>
  <p>2 Pillars of JavaScript</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prototype Inheritance: Inheritance is an object getting access to the properties and methods of another object. -- Arrays and functions get access to the methods and properties of objects</li>
    <li>Closures</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The handling of Prototype Inheritance and Closures makes JavaScript multi-paradigm</p>
